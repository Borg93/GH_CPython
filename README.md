#### The Idea of this plugin is to provide a component that implements CPython codes inside grasshopper.
- It requires having Python2.7 installed in your machine `C:\Python27\`, it is pereferred that you download one of the bundles that include all the required python scientific libraries such as [Python(x,y)](https://python-xy.github.io/), [Andconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)
- You have to run Rhino as adminstrator at first.
